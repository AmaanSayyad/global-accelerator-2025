## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** and **Ollama** installed
- **Git** for version control

### Quick Start
```bash
# Choose a demo app (increment your project number so it is unique)
cp -r demo-app-TEXTSTREAM-TRACK ./00_HACKATHON-SUBMISSIONS/0001_my-ai-app

# Setup and run
cd ./00_HACKATHON-SUBMISSIONS/my-ai-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Ultimate Vibe Code Prompt
```
You are an expert AI developer helping create a sentiment analysis chat application for the OpenxAI Global Accelerator 2025 Hackathon.

**TASK**: Create a new sentiment analysis chat app based on the TEXTSTREAM-TRACK template

**STEPS**:
1. **Research the repository structure**:
   - Examine all demo-app folders in the root directory
   - Study the TEXTSTREAM-TRACK/demo-app-BASIC-CHAT-APP structure
   - Check the current submissions in 00_HACKATHON-SUBMISSIONS to determine the next project number

2. **Create project folder**:
   - Create a new folder in 00_HACKATHON-SUBMISSIONS with format: 000X_Project-Name
   - Increment the project number from the highest existing number
   - Use a descriptive name like "sentiment-analyzer" or "mood-chat"

3. **Build the sentiment analysis app**:
   - Copy the TEXTSTREAM-TRACK/demo-app-BASIC-CHAT-APP structure as your base
   - Modify the chat interface to include:
     * Text input area for user messages
     * AI response area with streaming responses
     * **Sentiment indicator** showing conversation mood (peaceful, neutral, angry, excited, etc.)
     * Visual mood indicators (emojis, colors, progress bars)
   - Update the API route to analyze sentiment using Ollama
   - Enhance the UI with Tailwind CSS for a modern, polished look

4. **Technical requirements**:
   - Use Next.js 15 with TypeScript
   - Integrate with Ollama for AI responses
   - Implement real-time sentiment analysis
   - Add visual feedback for conversation mood
   - Ensure responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Include proper error handling and loading states

5. **UI/UX enhancements**:
   - Add mood-based color themes
   - Include animated sentiment indicators
   - Create intuitive conversation flow
   - Add helpful placeholder text and instructions

**CRITICAL FIXES TO IMPLEMENT**:
- **Dependency Management**: Use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to resolve React version conflicts
- **JSON Parsing Safety**: Implement robust JSON parsing with try-catch blocks for AI responses
- **Fallback Sentiment Analysis**: Create keyword-based fallback when AI sentiment analysis fails
- **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for API failures and malformed responses
- **Package.json Conflicts**: Ensure React and React-DOM versions are explicitly specified
- **Multiple Lockfiles**: Remove duplicate package-lock.json files to prevent conflicts
- **Ollama Model Verification**: Check if required model is available before starting the app

**TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST**:
- [ ] Verify Ollama is running and model is downloaded (`ollama list`)
- [ ] Test API endpoint with curl before running the app
- [ ] Check for dependency conflicts and resolve with --legacy-peer-deps
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling in sentiment analysis
- [ ] Validate JSON parsing with try-catch blocks
- [ ] Test fallback sentiment analysis when AI fails

**DELIVERABLE**: A fully functional sentiment analysis chat app that can detect and display the emotional tone of conversations in real-time with robust error handling and fallback systems.
